# Tower of Hanoi

This is a puzzle created by Edouard Lucas in 1883. It involves 3 rods with a number of disks of differing size. The puzzle starts with all disks on 1 rod, ordered by size, with the largest disk at the base. It thus resembles a pagoda, where each ascending tier of a tower is smaller than the tier beneath it.

The goal is to move all disks from 1 rod to another under the following restrictions:

- Only 1 disk may be moved each iteration.
- A larger disk may never be on top of a smaller disk.

This puzzle is old and well studied. Notable solutions are iterative, recursive, and binary. The minimum number of moves required, for *n* disks, is always 2<sup>*n*</sup> - 1.
