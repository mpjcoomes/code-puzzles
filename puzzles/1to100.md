# Sum 1 to 100
Add together all numbers between 1 and 100.

This can be done using an aggregate builtin, a loop, or Gauss's algorithm.

As a child, Gauss found that pairing numbers (i.e. 1+100, 2+99, 3+98) resulted in 101 each time. If there are 50 pairs, then 101*50 = 5050. This was abstracted into a formula for summing series:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

### Python
```python
# Aggregate function
sum(range(101))

# Loop
def sum_series(n):
    tot = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        tot += i
    return tot

print(sum_series(100))

# Guass
def gauss(n):
    return int(n * (n + 1) / 2)

print(gauss(100))

```
